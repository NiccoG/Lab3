This is a simplified, not online, minimal graphics version of Wordle, coded entirely in java for a university project in 2023. 
It is made for 5 letter words but can be eventually adjusted for more. The java swing interface is completely fine-tuned to the current settings and therefore requires modifying for any and every changes.
The correct way to use the application is to start the Server.jar before the client(s).jar. The closing order is client>server, possibly using the "exit" keyword and restraining from directly closing the window.
It works in any language as long as it uses the english alphabet. Untested for other language groups but I doubt it retains functionality.
